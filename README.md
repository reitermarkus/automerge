# Automerge Action

This action allows merging pull requests automatically if they have been approved and status checks have passed.
GitHub's branch protection rules are used to determine if auto-merging is allowed for a specific branch.

Auto-merging is enabled for a branch given the following criteria:

- The **Require pull request reviews before merging** rule and the additional **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed** rule
  are enabled for the branch. This ensures that no changes to the pull request are possible between the approval and the automatic merging.

- The **Require status checks to pass before merging** rule is enabled and at least one status check is selected.


## Inputs

| Name | Required  | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `token` | yes | A GitHub Token other than the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` needs to be specified in order to be able to trigger other workflows. |
| `merge-method` | no | Specify which merge method to use. By default, will select the first one available in this order: `merge`, `squash`, `rebase` |
| `squash-title` | no | Use the pull request title as the commit message when squashing. |
| `do-not-merge-labels` | no | When any of the labels in this comma-separated list is applied to a pull request, it will not be merged automatically. |
| `required-labels` | no | Comma-separated list of labels that are required to be applied to a pull request for it to be merged automatically. |
| `pull-request` | no | Try merging the specified pull request automatically. For example, you can pass an input from a `workflow_dispatch` event. |
| `dry-run` | no | If set to `true`, will not actually merge pull requests but still perform all other checks. |
